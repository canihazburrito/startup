### General

Don't forget to add:
- a display of the username after login
- tie breaker feature?

### First assignment

### Startup Specification
[Startup Specification Notes](StartupSpec.md)

### HTML
[Startup html notes](startupHTML.md)

### Simon CSS
I added a feature to the play buttons so that they would darken when hovered over. I did this by using the :hover selector.
