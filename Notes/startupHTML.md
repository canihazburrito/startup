## What I learned

This assignment was challenging but very rewarding. What made it challenging was that I had to take what I learned from the Simon deliverable and then apply it to my very own site. I couldn't just copy what was written for the simon html, I had to format and add my very own features to reflect the fuctionality of my web application. I had to look up a lot of specific tags and attributes for the different elements. One feature that I am particularly proud of is the editable title on lobby.html. Additionally, I hade to find a free font to upload so that I could use the icon next to the title to improve usability. We will see how implementing CSS might impact how that icon appears. Another struggle I had was that after I deployed the html, the joincreate.html was flagged as dangerous by Google so I had to troubleshoot. This led me to their Search Console application. I verrified my ownership of the website by adding metadata to the head of the files and that cleared the problem up. Throughout this assignment, I also become even more familiar with the console, VSCode, and Git which will help in this class and other classes.
