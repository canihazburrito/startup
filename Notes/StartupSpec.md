## What I learned

Trying to think of what I wanted to create took quite a bit of thought. I was also worried about whether the project I came up with would be achievable. After seeking advice from a TA, I decided on my topic which is a custom voting application. As I did some surface level research for the project, I have become excited about creating a simple application. I have learned more about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create websites. Additionally, I continue to learn about the GitHub system and Markdown syntax.
