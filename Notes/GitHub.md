## What I Learned

This assignment was actually quite challenging for being the first real assignment. It has introduced me to a whole new world of UI and vocabulary that I need to familiarize myself with. Interacting with GitHub so far has been very straightforward but navigating VSCode has been where I struggle. I think this will take some tinkering on my part to find what settings I prefer as far as what is displayed on my screen and also how my system reacts by default.
