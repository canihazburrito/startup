## What I learned

This assignment was more difficult than I had anticipated. While I was learning CSS, it seemed to come pretty naturally to me so I thought I could easily complete the CSS for my application. However, trying to incorporate Bootstrap is what made it so difficult I think. It is my personal opinion that CSS syntax is very intuitive amd it is very easy to find answers and examples on Stack Exchange and similar sites. Bootstrap on the other hand, uses a different method that didn't really click with me. The class naming system is confusing and the documentation on the Bootstrap website didn't really help. If I were to do this assignment again, I would just code everything myself in CSS instead of using the Bootstrap templates. I will have to practice more with Bootstrap so that I become more comfortable with it.
