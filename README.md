# startup- Custon Votes
This is my startup application for BYU CS 260.

## Notes
These are my [notes](notes.md) for what I have learned during this course.

## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
Often times it can be difficult to reach a decision when you are working with a large group of people, especially when you have to work with them over the internet. It is a challenge to gather everyone's input and even list all of the options in the first place. The Custom Votes application seeks to solve these problems by providing a simple user interface, giving you only the options you *want*. Custom Votes provides private lobbies where users can create a topic and then add custom options which can then be voted on by those with the lobby code. Every user is able to enter their input, ensuring that no option is left behind. The votes are tallied up in realtime, offering a clear winner and a decision made. Say goodbye to longwinded debates about where to eat, or which video game to play by using Custom Votes.
